<h2>Question 1: Is there a Correlation between Budget and Revenue?</h2>
<h3> How has this Changed over the decades?</h3>

<h5> Findings:</h5>
With a correlation coefficient of 0.75, there is a strong relationship between budget and revenue. It is also interesting to note that this relationship has strengthened throughout the last 4 decades. Going from 0.36 in 1980s to 0.90 in the 2010s!!

<h5> Recommendations:</h5>
Given this information, it is clear that the key is to spend spend spend when it comes to revenue generation is all you are worried about.

<h2>Question 2: Does ROI vary by Budget Category?</h2>
<h6> Looking at Budgets under $100 million</h6>
<img src ='images/Question2'>

<h5> Findings:</h5>
ROI is different depending on budget. Notably, a bigger budget does not always result in a bigger return. 
For Example, the 40-50 million category returns less on average than the 10-20 million category

<h5> Recommendations:</h5>
You should carefully choose your budget when looking for the best return. For example, if you have a budget of 100 million, you should choose to only spend 80-90 to get a better return.

<h2>Question 3: Does the performance of a movie change based on the day/month of release?</h2>
<h6> Looking at median Gross</h6>

<h5>Findings:</h5>
The Best Month on average for gross revenue has changed throughout the decades. July has stayed constant in the top 2. Notably, December releases have become less and less profitable.
<h5> Recommendations:</h5>
Focus on Animation, Adventure and Mystery films  as these yield the highest return.
Steer clear of Documentaries, as they are loss making, on average.

<h2>Future Analysis</h2>
* Create a better way of sorting through genres, when movies have multiple genres, potentially using sub categories
* Explore the effects the movie crew can have on ROI. In terms of directors ,actors etc.
* Explore the effect awards have on ROI. Do films that win more awards have a higher ROI?
* Complete sentiment analysis on Rotten Tomato reviews
