## Question 1: Is there a Correlation between Budget and Revenue?
###### Sub Question - How has this Changed over the decades?

#####Findings:
With a correlation coefficient of 0.75, there is a strong relationship between budget and revenue. It is also interesting to note that this relationship has strengthened throughout the last 4 decades. Going from 0.36 in 1980s to 0.90 in the 2010s!!

#####Recommendations:
Given this information, it is clear that the key is to spend spend spend when it comes to revenue generation is all you are worried about.

## Question 2: Does ROI vary by Budget Category?
###### Looking at Budgets under $100 million
<img src ='images/Question2'>

#####Findings:
ROI is different depending on budget. Notably, a bigger budget does not always result in a bigger return. 
For Example, the 40-50 million category returns less on average than the 10-20 million category

#####Recommendations:
You should carefully choose your budget when looking for the best return. For example, if you have a budget of 100 million, you should choose to only spend 80-90 to get a better return.

## Question 3: IS the performance of a movie affected by the month in which it is released?
<h6> Looking at median Gross Revenue </h6>

#####Findings:
The Best Month on average for gross revenue has changed throughout the decades. July has stayed constant in the top 2. Notably, December releases have become less and less profitable.
#####Recommendations:
Look at releasing movies in July and November.

## Question 4: An Exloration of Genres
#### How do Gross Revenue and ROI change across the genres?

#####Findings:
It is clear from the graph below that ROI varies massively by genre. 

#####Recommendations:
Focus on Animation, Adventure and Mystery films  as these yield the highest return.
Steer clear of Documentaries, as they are loss making, on average.

# Future Analysis
* Create a better way of sorting through genres, when movies have multiple genres, potentially using sub categories
* Explore the effects the movie crew can have on ROI. In terms of directors ,actors etc.
* Explore the effect awards have on ROI. Do films that win more awards have a higher ROI?
* Complete sentiment analysis on Rotten Tomato reviews
